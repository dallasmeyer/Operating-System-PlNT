Your design
document should include a separate section for each of the four other tasks (argument parsing, system calls, process termination message, and user memory). 

For each section, you should outline 
(1) any data structures that you created or extended in your design; 
(2) any algorithms that you created for your design; 
(3) any synchronization used in your design;
(4) a justification of your design (Why is it correct? Why is it fast? etc.).


You should aim to have enough detail in your design that a fellow 134 student would be capable of re-implementing your system by following it. Note: if your design does not require any of these features (e.g., you do not have data structures for the process termination message)
specify “N/A”.
