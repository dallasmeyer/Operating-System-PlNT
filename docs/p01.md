# Project 1 - Alarm Clock

## Instructions
Your submission should include a design document that describes key design decisions that
you made in your system. The document should be located at docs/p01.md. Your design
document should include a separate section for each of the two other tasks (shell and alarm
clock). For each section, you should outline (1) any data structures that you created or
extended in your design (note: you can specify N/A if you do not create any); (2) any
algorithms that you created for your design; (3) any synchronization used in your design;
and (4) a justification of your design. You should aim to have enough detail in your design
that a fellow 134 student would be capable of re-implementing your system by following it.

1) Data structures created/extended
2) algorithms
3) synchronization
