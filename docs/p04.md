# Extra Credit: Buffer Cache
## Data Structures

We created a file named cache.h/c that includes the functionality of the buffer cache, along with the struct of each buffer's cache "block".

`cache.h`
Here is the buffer block struct, which represents each item in the cache -- storing various flag values and the sector and list element to make implementing the buffer cache easier.
```
struct buffer_block {
    int dirty;          /* flag for knowing if the block has been changed */
    int used;           /* flag for knowing if the block has been used yet */
    int accessed;       /* flag for knowing if the block has been accessed recently */
    block_sector_t sector;  /* on-disk location (sector number) of the block */
    void *vaddr;  /* virtual address of the associated buffer cache entry */
    struct list_elem elem;  /* List element for inclusion in cache_list */
    uint8_t buf[BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE];
};
```

The buffer_cache_find helper function is used within cache.c buffer writes/reads to locate buffer blocks.

Expected read/write functions have also been created.

```
/* Helper function to find a buffer block in the cache */
struct buffer_block *buffer_cache_find(block_sector_t sector);
/* Read a block from the buffer cache or disk */
void buffer_cache_read(block_sector_t sector, void *target, int sector_ofs, int chunk_size);
/* Write a block to the buffer cache */
void buffer_cache_write(block_sector_t sector, const void *source, int sector_ofs, int chunk_size);
/* Close the buffer cache, flushing all dirty entries to disk. this is a write-back method */
void buffer_cache_close(void);
```

The buffer_cache_init function is explanatory, where it initializes the buffer cache list (for block entries).

```
void buffer_cache_init(void) {
    // Initialize the lock and buffer cache list
    list_init(&cache_list);
    lock_init(&buffer_cache_lock);

    // Create the buffer cache 
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SECTORS; i++) {
        // Create a buffer block entry
        struct buffer_block *entry = malloc(sizeof(struct buffer_block));
        if (entry == NULL) {
            PANIC("Failed to allocate memory for buffer cache entry");
        }
        // Allocate BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE bytes for the block data 
        entry->vaddr = malloc(BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);  
        if(entry->vaddr == NULL) {
            PANIC("Failed to allocate memory for buffer cache data");
        }
        // Fill the initial values
        entry->sector = (block_sector_t) -1;  /* Initialize sector to an invalid value */
        entry->dirty = 0;
        entry->used = 0;
        entry->accessed = 0;
        // Add to the list
        list_push_back(&cache_list, &entry->elem);
    }
}
```



## Algorithms

To initialize the buffer cache, in `buffer_cache_init()` for each sector, we malloc'ed a buffer block entry along with initializing the entries's values with 0 or the sector number, lastly appending the entry to a list that builds up the cache.

The `buffer_cache_find()` function simply iterates through the cache's list of blocks, until it can find a block entry that matches the specified sector.

The both `buffer_cache_write` and `buffer_cache_read` functions first locate the specified buffer_block instance using `buffer_cache_find(sector)`. If it does not find the entry -- "cache miss" -- it'll evict (via `buffer_cache_evict`) any unused buffer block -- performing a `block_read` during a cache_read. For a cache_write, but only does `block_read` if block entry wasn't used/dirty. 

The write-back feature occurs by writing the data to the buffer cache first, rather than immediately to the disk.

A flush of all dirty blocks to disk is done during a 'buffer_cache_close'.

Seen below is the buffer_cache_write function to help provide a better picture of this algorithm:
```
/* Write a block to the buffer cache */
void buffer_cache_write(block_sector_t sector, const void *source, int sector_ofs, int chunk_size) {
...
    struct buffer_block *entry = buffer_cache_find(sector);
    if (entry == NULL) {
        // Cache miss: need eviction
        //printf("    (buffer_cache_write) cache miss\n");
        entry = buffer_cache_evict();  // Evict a cache block if necessary.
        ASSERT(entry != NULL);

        // Read the sector data into the cache block only if necessary.
        if (!entry->used || entry->sector != sector) {
            block_read(fs_device, sector, entry->buf);  // Load the sector data into the cache.
            entry->sector = sector;
            entry->dirty = 0;  // Initially not dirty because we just loaded it.
        }
    } 

    // Mark the entry as used, accessed, and dirty since it's being modified.
    entry->used = 1;
    entry->accessed = 1;
    entry->dirty = 1;

    // Perform the write operation to the buffer, not the disk.
    memcpy(entry->buf + sector_ofs, source, chunk_size);
    //printf("(buffer_cache_write) finished\n");
    lock_release(&buffer_cache_lock);  // Release the lock after the operation.
}
```


## Synchronization

As usual, does a buffer_cache_lock acquire during any reads and writes.

## New changes from Project 2

Filesys.c has been heavily modified to use the buffer cache in tandem with directory functions.

## Justification (eg. correct, fast, etc)

We implemented the buffer cache early on, as once we got it working it did a lot of the "heavy work" for the rest of the lab. As it is easier to use a cache vs doing many block reads and writes.

Using a PintOS list for the cache made it easy to essentially store and index items.

# Extensible Files
## Data Structures

To reduce external fragmentation, we implemented a index-based approach vs the previous sequential system. In the inode_disk struct, we added a `block_sector_t` array of direct blocks, along with a indirect_block, and double_indirect block:
```
struct inode_disk
{
  off_t length;                       /**< File size in bytes. */
  unsigned magic;                     /**< Magic number. */
  bool directory;                     // New: if true is directory

  // New: using indexing direct/indirect blocks
  block_sector_t direct_blocks[DIRECT_COUNT];
  block_sector_t indirect_block;
  block_sector_t double_indirect_block;
};
```

To get the sector block from a certain index, a we created a brand new function `get_index_sector`:
```
static block_sector_t get_index_sector(const struct inode_disk *disk, off_t index) {
    // printf("(get_index_sector) start\n");

    // index is in direct block
    if (index < DIRECT_COUNT) {
        // printf("(get_index_sector) index is in direct block\n");
        return disk->direct_blocks[index];
    }

    // index is in indirect block
    index -= DIRECT_COUNT;
    if (index < INDIRECT_COUNT) {
      // printf("(get_index_sector) index is in indirect block\n");
      block_sector_t indirect_blocks[INDIRECT_COUNT];
      buffer_cache_read(disk->indirect_block, indirect_blocks, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
      return indirect_blocks[index];
    }

    // index is in doubly indirect block
    index -= INDIRECT_COUNT;
    if (index < (INDIRECT_COUNT * INDIRECT_COUNT)) {
      // printf("(get_index_sector) index is in doubly indirect block\n");
      block_sector_t doubly_indirect_blocks[INDIRECT_COUNT];
      buffer_cache_read(disk->double_indirect_block, doubly_indirect_blocks, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
      block_sector_t indirect_block;
      size_t indirect_index = index / INDIRECT_COUNT;
      size_t direct_index = index % INDIRECT_COUNT;
      buffer_cache_read(doubly_indirect_blocks[indirect_index], &indirect_block, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
      buffer_cache_read(indirect_block, doubly_indirect_blocks, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
      return doubly_indirect_blocks[direct_index];
    }

    // Handle index out of bounds
    return -1;
}
```

## Algorithms

Regarding the extensible files, would need to simple check if the write size is larger than the file's actual length. If so, then call a `inode_allocate` on the current inode and store that new sector into a buffer_cache write.

The functions inode_allocate/inode_deallocate --  which all require writing or reading to a block (technically a buffer cache write/read at first) -- must iterate through the whole direct/indirect/double-indirect block structure.

This is done by first iterating through 123 "indexed" direct blocks and allocating the block via `free_map_allocate` (initializing block values to zero). 

If length is higher than 123, then must go a layer deeper and use the indirect blocks. Where first acquiring the indirect_blocks's instance in the disk_inode -- instantiating the (128) indirect_blocks and zeroing its memory if an allocation. Lastly, if length goes to beyond, then must use the double indirect block structure that stores even more blocks.

Some of the code can be seen below:
```
  // write to the direct blocks
  for (size_t i = 0; i < direct_ct; i++) {
    if (disk_inode->direct_blocks[i] == 0) {
      if (!free_map_allocate(1, &disk_inode->direct_blocks[i])) {
        // failed to allocate
        return false;
      }
      // init the block's values to zero
      buffer_cache_write(disk_inode->direct_blocks[i], zero, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
    }
  }

  // write to the indirect block
  if (indirect_ct > 0) {
    ...
    // read and write (zeroed) indirect block
    buffer_cache_read(disk_inode->indirect_block, indirect_blocks, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < indirect_ct; i++) {
      if (indirect_blocks[i] == 0) {
        if (!free_map_allocate(1, &indirect_blocks[i])) {
          return false;
        }
        buffer_cache_write(indirect_blocks[i], zero, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
      }
    }
    buffer_cache_write(disk_inode->indirect_block, indirect_blocks, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
  }

... [omitted double indirect due to it being similar structure to indirect block, but just an extra layer for writes/reads]
```
This style of doing direct, then indirect, then double indirect is also similar as to what is being done in `get_index_sector`. Where as seen above, would either do a write to the inode disk direct blocks, get indirect block instance, or get a indirect block instance + the indirect instance inside of that (double).

## Synchronization
As usual, used locks during any read/writes. 

## New changes from Project 2

All the code to implement extensible files was done by heavily modifying `inode.c`.
For the extensible file implementation, we modified inode_write_at to do a simple size check, explained earlier in the algorithm section:
```
off_t
inode_write_at(struct inode *inode, const void *buffer_, off_t size, off_t offset)
{
  // printf("(inode_write_at) start!\n");
  const uint8_t *buffer = buffer_;
  off_t bytes_written = 0;

  if (inode->deny_write_cnt != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // extend the file
  off_t new_length = offset + size;
  if (new_length > inode->data.length) {
    inode_allocate(&inode->data, new_length);
    inode->data.length = new_length;
    buffer_cache_write(inode->sector, &inode->data, 0, BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE);
  }
```
As can see above, the file is extended through allocated more
Modifed both the inode_disk and inode structs to support the new block system.


## Justification (eg. correct, fast, etc)

We modified inode_write_at, as recommended during lecture but also because doing an inode file write should extend the size of the file.

Choosing the direct, indirect, and double indirect block system allowed doing more simple block indexing for small files (as small files tend to be small). All while having the flexibility to have much larger files with nested indirect_blocks (as large files tend to be very large).

The choice of getting the block counts for the amount of direct, indirect, and double indirect blocks at start of the allocate/deallocate functions made it easier to simply structure the code without needing to do any fancy calculations in between each allocation/deallocation.

# Subdirectories
## Data Structures

New syscalls added in `syscall.c`, as required.
```
/* Create a directory named dir */
bool mkdir(const char *dir) {
  bool success;

  lock_acquire(&file_lock);
  success = filesys_create(dir, 0, true);
  lock_release(&file_lock);

  return success;
}

/* Read a directory entry from fd */
bool readdir(int fd, char *name) {
  struct file_inst *file_inst = locate_file(fd);
  struct dir *dir = (struct dir *) file_inst->file_p;

  if (!inode_is_dir(dir_get_inode(dir))) {
    return false;
  }

  return dir_readdir(dir, name);
}

/* Return true if fd represents a directory or false if it doesn't */
bool isdir(int fd) {
  struct file_inst *file_inst = locate_file(fd);
  return inode_is_dir(file_get_inode(file_inst->file_p));
}

/* Return the inode number of the inode associated with fd (can be file or directory) */
int inumber(int fd) {
  struct file_inst *file_inst = locate_file(fd);
  return inode_get_inumber(file_get_inode(file_inst->file_p));
}
```

Many helper functions in filesys.c were created:
- split_path (const char *path, char *dir, char *base): Splits a path into directory and base name components. Returns true if successful, false otherwise. 
- struct dir *dir_open_path(const char *path): Opens the directory for the given path
- get_next_part (char part[NAME_MAX + 1], const char **srcp): Check that the directory has not been moved
- get_next_part (char part[NAME_MAX + 1], const char **srcp): extracts the next part of the path.

## Algorithms


As seen above, the new syscalls are fairly straight forward with its own respective getter functions.

Regarding one of the helper functions, split_path simply splits the path into base and name components by checking for string terminating characters.

Lots of directory functionality is attributed to `dir_open_path()`. For its algorithm, we first copy the path name to tokenize/parse. Then determine the starting directory based on the path is absolute/relative. Finally, tokenizing and traversing the path using a for loop that for each iteration checks if the directory doesn't exist (returns NULL) otherwise continues to open the directory and continuing to open further directories till the last "directory". After that, we do a final check that the directory hasn't been moved and return the current directory.


For reference, here's the code for `dir_open_path`:
```
struct dir *dir_open_path(const char *path) {
  // Copy of path to tokenize
  char s[strlen(path) + 1];
  strlcpy(s, path, sizeof(s));

  // Determine starting directory based on whether the path is absolute or relative
  struct dir *curr = (path[0] == '/') ? dir_open_root() : 
                     (thread_current()->cwd ? dir_reopen(thread_current()->cwd) : dir_open_root());
  
  if (curr == NULL) return NULL;

  // Tokenize and traverse the path
  char *token, *save_ptr;
  for (token = strtok_r(s, "/", &save_ptr); token != NULL; token = strtok_r(NULL, "/", &save_ptr)) {
    struct inode *inode = NULL;
    
    // Check if the directory does not exist
    if (!dir_lookup(curr, token, &inode)) {  
      dir_close(curr);
      return NULL;
    }
    
    struct dir *next = dir_open(inode);
    if (next == NULL) { 
       // Failed to open next directory, close
      dir_close(curr);
      return NULL;
    }
    
    dir_close(curr);
    curr = next;
  }

  // Check that the directory has not been moved
  if (inode_is_removed(dir_get_inode(curr))) {
    dir_close(curr);
    return NULL;
  }

  return curr;
}
```

As for getting the next part of the path, we keep iterating an copying characters until we extract the next dir/file:

```
get_next_part (char part[NAME_MAX + 1], const char **srcp)
{
  const char *src = *srcp;
  char *dst = part;

  /* Skip leading slashes. If it’s all slashes, we’re done. */
  while (*src == '/')
    src++;
  if (*src == '\0')
    return false;

  /* Copy up to NAME_MAX characters from SRC to DST. Add null terminator. */
  while (*src != '/' && *src != '\0') {
    if (dst < part + NAME_MAX)
      *dst++ = *src;
    src++;
  }
  *dst = '\0';

  /* Advance source pointer. */
  *srcp = src;
  return true;
}
```

## Synchronization

NA

## New changes from Project 2

Lots of changes were made in directory.c/h and filesys.c/h, along with syscall.c obviously.

Since we are reading beyond the root directory, `dir_open_root()` calls were deleted and instead replaced with `dir_open_path()`.

To be used in mkdir, `filesys_create()` had to be modified to allocate the directory name, along with base names.

As explained in the above data struct section, many new functions were created.


## Justification (eg. correct, fast, etc)

Using dir_open_path() as its own function, made it easy to open a certain directory, and as such was embedded in the filesys create, open and remove functions -- replacing the old open_dir_root() function.

Having specific getter functions for the new syscalls, encouraged more abstraction and modularity.


# Working Directories
## Data Structures

Implementation of the required `chdir()` syscall
```
/* Change the current working directory */
bool chdir(const char *dir) {
  struct dir *new_dir = dir_open_path(dir);

  if (new_dir == NULL) {
    return false;
  }

  dir_close(thread_current()->cwd);
  thread_current()->cwd = new_dir;
  return true;
}
```

## Algorithms

Change directory simply change's the thread's current working directory to a specified path.

Didn't have a 100% complete working implementation of this assignment unfortunately.

## Synchronization
NA

## New changes from Project 2

In syscall.c we added the sys_chdir case, where (after a quick valid check) call the chdir() syscall:
```
// Case 15: Change the current working directory
case SYS_CHDIR:
  debug_printf("(syscall) syscall_funct is [SYS_CHDIR]\n");
  if (!valid_addr(stack_p + 1) || !valid_str(*(stack_p + 1))) { exit(-1); }
  f->eax = chdir(*(stack_p + 1));
  break;
```

## Justification (eg. correct, fast, etc)

Utilizing the `dir_open_path()` function here seemed trivial since needed to get the instance of the specified directory, and set the thread to point to it.
